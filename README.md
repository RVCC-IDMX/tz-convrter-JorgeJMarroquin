# Introduction of the TZ app

This application provides the desired time and date of a specific place in the world in real time.

# Instructions on how to use the TZ app

To know the date and time of a specific place you just have to write in your terminal the command `node tz` followed by the place from which you want to know the current date and time (argument) such as `"Asia/Kolkata"` or `"Eurpe/Berlin"` followed by the command `"--format"`, which is not required for the application to work, but it gives a better format to the displayed information.

Here are some examples of the application performance.
